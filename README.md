# Dataset:
I used a dataset that contains 2 folders. Each of these folders contains mammography images.


# Segmentation Phase:
This phase focuses on detectioning masses in mammography images. In this project, I used the image segmentation technique to identify the mass in mammography images.Image segmentation is a computer vision technique that partitions a digital image into discrete groups of pixels—image segments—to inform object detection and related tasks. By parsing an image's complex visual data into specifically shaped segments, image segmentation enables faster, more advanced image processing.
